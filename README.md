Flask social login demo
===

User can sign in with Google, Facebook and Twitter accounts (through oauth1/oauth2).

I want to retrieve user id, name, E-mail and friend list in this demo app.

Please rename `config_template.py` to `config.py`, and filling the key and secret strings.

Thanks to [authomatic](https://github.com/peterhudec/authomatic).
